    "THE CONVERSE GREATLY REDUCES THE RUNTIME OF THE PROGRAM, BUT DOES MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ANSWER.\n",
    "##### *The alternative for this is also exists here and is tracked\n",
    "### - *IF A BURNED TREE CAN BURN AGAIN:* IF MORE THEN HALF OF THE FISRT IS BURNING, MOST OF THE FOREST IS BURNING\n",
    "Reasoning: Let's first look at the half smallest. The probability is bernoulli, and the sum of all active fires is going to be a binomial. We can expect then np trees to burn. Probability of (South and North) Eeast is going to be 0.3, so we can expect 0.3n trees to be burned. If half the grid is burning, we will assume around 20/2 = 10 trees burning, thus we can expect about 3 more trees to the East. Similar logic applies toward North and South, and West has an increased chance, so the fire has a higher chance to stay alive. \n",
    "### - IF THE FIRE GOES OFF THE GRID,  IT IS EXTINGUISHED \n",
    "### - THERE ARE MULTIPLE FIRES (SINCE PROBABILITY OF A FIRE DOESN'T UP OR DOWN OR LEFT OR RIGHT GREATER THEN 1). THEY SPREAD IF THEIR CHANCE IS UP."
