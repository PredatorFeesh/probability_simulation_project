# ## ASSUMPTIONS:
# ### - IF A TREE BURNED, WE CAN MOVE ON IT AGAIN (EXTINGUISHED). 
# THE CONVERSE GREATLY REDUCES THE RUNTIME OF THE PROGRAM, BUT DOES MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ANSWER.
# ##### *The alternative for this is also exists here and is tracked
# ### - *IF A BURNED TREE CAN BURN AGAIN:* IF MORE THEN HALF OF THE FISRT IS BURNING, MOST OF THE FOREST IS BURNING
# Reasoning: Let's first look at the half smallest. The probability is bernoulli, and the sum of all active fires is going to be a binomial. We can expect then np trees to burn. Probability of (South and North) Eeast is going to be 0.3, so we can expect 0.3n trees to be burned. If half the grid is burning, we will assume around 20/2 = 10 trees burning, thus we can expect about 3 more trees to the East. Similar logic applies toward North and South, and West has an increased chance, so the fire has a higher chance to stay alive. 
# ### - IF THE FIRE GOES OFF THE GRID,  IT IS EXTINGUISHED 
# ### - THERE ARE MULTIPLE FIRES (SINCE PROBABILITY OF A FIRE DOESN'T UP OR DOWN OR LEFT OR RIGHT GREATER THEN 1). THEY SPREAD IF THEIR CHANCE IS UP.

# We want our true value, with 95% probability, to be within 0.005 of the true answer. <br>
# $P\{|\hat{p} - p| > \epsilon \} \leq \alpha$, where $\epsilon=0.005$, and $\alpha = 0.05$ (since we want 95% accuracy), so: <br>
# $P\{|\hat{p} - p| > 0.005\} \leq 0.05$. We do now have an intelligent guess here, so we will calculate: $N = 0.25 (\frac{z_{0.05}}{0.005})^2$ = $0.25 (\frac{1.6449}{0.005})^2 \approx 27057$ iterations.

# We get a huge variance, thus telling to us that this simulation is not really accurate. <br>
# 
# Next, we look for the probability that the estimator is off by 25 trees. This is P(137 < X < 187). In order to solve this, we will need to assume a certain distribution. Because we tend to be at extremes, this looks most like the [U distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-quadratic_distribution).
# 
# 

# $f(x) = \alpha (x-\beta)^2  , \alpha = \frac{12}{(b-a)^3} , \beta = \frac{a+b}{2}$ <br>
# In our case, $a,b$ are equal to the two maximum extremes, $1, 1000$. <br>
# So: $\alpha = \frac{12}{(b-a)^3} = \frac{12}{999^3} = 1.2 * 10^{-8} , \beta = \frac{a+b}{2} = \frac{1001}{2} = 500.5$<br>
# 
# $F(x) = \frac{\alpha}{3} ((x-\beta)^3 - (\beta - \alpha)^3)  $ <br>
# $1 - P(137 < X < 187) = 1 - (F(187) - F(137)) \approx 1 - 0.6 = 0.94 $ <br>
# # HOWEVER, we will assume normal in order to get a more approximate answer as the question implies that it expects this to be normal. Going through this calculation again:
# $1 -P(137 < X < 187) = 1 - P(\frac{137-161}{364} < X < \frac{187-161}{364}) = 1 - P( -0.06593 < Z < 0.07143 ) = 1 - \phi(0.07143) + \phi(-0.06593) \approx 0.98$ <br>
# So part (d), answer 0.98.

# (e) Yes, the house is in real danger. The house and the origin of the fire are only 50 trees apart. Although it may seem that the probability thus is $7.18 * 10^{-27}$, in reality, there are $1 000$ possible cells for the fire to spread to the house. This makes the probability of the house burning significantly higher.
